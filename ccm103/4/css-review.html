					<h1>Intro to CSS Review</h1>
				</div><!-- .page-header -->
				<h3>CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look</h3>
				
				<h3>Rules are made up of selectors (that specific the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).</h3>
				
				<h3>Different types of selectors allow youth target your rules at different elements</h3>
				
				<h3>Declarations are made u of tow parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.<br><small>For example the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface</small></h3>
				<h3>CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.</h3>
